# Reaction Tester Game

This project is a simple **Reaction Tester Game** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It measures your reaction time by showing a prompt after a random delay, and you need to click as quickly as possible. The time taken to click is then displayed as your reaction time.

## Code Explanation

### HTML Structure
- **HTML** contains the structure of the page:
  - A heading to title the game.
  - A button to start the game.
  - A display area for the countdown timer.
  - A prompt that shows after the countdown, where the user has to click to test their reaction.
  - A display area that shows the reaction time once the user clicks.

### CSS Styling
- **CSS** is used to style the page and ensure that elements are centered and look good on any screen.
  - The start button and prompt are styled to make them visible and easy to interact with.
  - Basic styling is applied to the countdown timer and results display.

### JavaScript Functionality
- **JavaScript** handles the functionality:
  - It controls the countdown timer and starts the test when the button is clicked.
  - A random delay is introduced before the prompt appears.
  - The reaction time is measured when the user clicks on the prompt.
  - The reaction time is displayed after the click.

## Usage
1. Open the **Reaction Tester Game** in a web browser.
2. Click on the **Start Game** button to begin.
3. Wait for the countdown to finish.
4. Click the prompt when it appears to test your reaction time.
